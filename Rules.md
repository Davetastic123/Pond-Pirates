Pond Pirate Rules
 
Description:
  Players earn gold from buying and selling goods, as well as shooting other pirates with cannon balls.

Winning:
  The first pirate to deliver 80 gold to the castle wins, and is crowned the Pirate Prince or Princess of the Pond.

Setup:
  Place 10 pearls on Raiders Reef, tigerseye on Hot Rock Haven, rum barrels on New Ore, and coffee beans on Surf Diego.  
  The upgraded (metal) cannonballs, get placed in the castle.
  Each player gets a boat, firing pin, and 6 cannonballs marked with their color.
  **INSERT ISLAND PLACEMENT**
  Each player starts with 5 gold
  
Play:
Only the player touches their boat.  You start at either small island with the Pirate flag sticking out of it.  You can start on either side.  You cannot move back to this hex once you leave it.
 
A turn consists of an action, then movement, or a movement then an action.  Each ship moves two hexes unless aided by the whirlpool.
 
The basic actions you're going to use most often are:
- Reloading one cannon. 
- Shooting your cannon. 
- Buying and selling goods.  
-  Riding the whirlpool.

The more situational actions are:
Picking up overboard items from an island.
Picking up your gold from the castle.
Buying more cannonballs or upgraded cannonballs from the castle.
Turning in the winning gold.
Turning your boat back up if knocked over.

Hex:
Only one player is allowed on a hex at a time.  You are allowed to jump over players but they get the option of firing at you before you pass.  This out of turn firing does not affect their turn.  You as the passing player, have to announce you are jumping over the other player and give them the option to shot you from the adjacent hex. 

Movement: 
Two hexes per turn.  Adults have to push their boats with one finger and it never leaves the board.
  
Whirlpool:
The whirlpool tile sits on top of the whirlpool picture in the middle of the board.  It costs a hex of movement to move onto the whirlpool.  When players place their boat on the tile they spin the boat, and it has to go around one full revolution.  If the boat stays on the tile it goes to the hex that the boat faced.  If the boat slides off the hex then it goes to whatever the nearest hex is to it.  You get no bonus movement for falling off the tile.  If you were successful you get to move two more hexes past where you landed.  It does not matter if you moved into the whirlpool with the first or second move of your turn.  

If you were successful in riding the whirlpool you get two more hexes of movement after being placed.  This allows for a turn of up to 5 total hexes of movement counting the move onto the whirlpool.  
 
 
Harbors:
Harbors are safe havens from attacking.  You cannot be attacked and you cannot attack.  It does not cost any extra movement to go in or out of the harbor.  There are four harbors that extend from a hex and are rectangles.  The Harbors cost 1g per turn.  Two ships can be in a harbor at the same time.  
  
Buying and Selling:
Pearls can only be sold at Surf Diego.  Tigerseye can only be sold at New Ore.  Rum and coffee can be sold at either Raider Reef or at Hot Rock Haven.  The hexes that you are able to buy and sell from all have a ship drawn on them, they are the one that the ports exit into.  You can buy and sell from inside the port.  You are allowed to buy and sell on the same turn, or sell and buy, but you cannot buy sell buy.  You are allowed to sell or buy multiple set of items then buy different types of items.  So for example you could sell rum and coffee then buy pearls all in the same action.
 
Buying any goods always costs 1 gold.  Gold used to buy items at Raiders Reef or Hot Rock Haven gets placed in the area marked coins.  All other money paid goes to the bank.  Rum and coffee always sells for a max of 3g, but you can accept less if you wish.  Pearls and tigerseye always sell for 5g.  

Stack your items carefully!  During your turn and for 3 seconds after any goods that hit the water are Overboard!  Any items knocked off by any action of an opponent can be placed back on your ship.  Ships can not be taken off the board to be stacked.  

Once an item is sold it stays at the port it was sold.  At the end of every players turn, 1 of every type of available goods goes back to its starting spot.  So if in a four player game you sell 4 rum and 4 coffee to raiders reef, when it comes back around to your turn all 8 of those goods will be back to where they started. 

Firing the cannons:
Firing 1-2 or 3 cannons all counts as one action per turn.  You cannot orientate your boat in between shots.  You hold your boat from the front or rear with two fingers and use the other hand to flick the firing pin into the boat firing off the cannon ball.  If you moved then fired your ship cannot turn after firing it’s last round.  Carefully remove the firing pin and leave the boat where it is.  

Each hit is rewarded with 5g that is placed at the castle in your stash.  A hit with an upgraded round is worth 30g.  

If your boat leaves the hex during your shot, any goods that were knocked out were replaced.  Your goods are not replaced and are Overboard.  

If you knock your own ship over, or another ship over, they must spend their action the next turn righting the ship before they can move.  If a ship is hit and moves out of it’s hex, it is returned to the original hex.  

Overboard:
Items that go overboard are placed in the nearest island.  If it is caused by an attack the attacker picks the island.  If it is from the whirlpool whatever hex the items fall on they go to the closest island to that.  If it falls off during movement the player who dropped them picks the island.  
 
Castle:
The Castle has four stashes, one for each player.  The gold and the expended cannonballs go to this spot.  You can stop by the drawbridge at any point and pick up your gold, or buy your cannonballs for 1g each.  

Upgraded cannonballs cost 15g a piece. 

You cannot end two turns in a row at the hex for the castle drawbridge.
 
Trading:
Any player can trade with any other player they are adjacent with any items or gold they both agree to. Players can agree to payment for an attack on another player for example.  These deals are a buyer beware, and players can decide not to make the attack and keep the gold or items.
